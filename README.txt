1: INSTRUCTIONS
Step 1: Read the entire readme before opening the site
Step 2: Double-click index.html. This will open the site in your default browser

2: CURRENT BUILD
The current build is still very small and rather un-impressive. 
There is currently 0 content as we work out what exactly we want to be putting up.
This is why each page is pretty much empty. 
Feel free to discuss content suggestions!

The current build exists only to demonstrate the current stylistic design decision. 
PLEASE SUBMIT FEEDBACK ON DESIGN DIRECTLY TO awiovanna@wpi.edu or and.iovanna@gmail.com.
MAKE SURE TO CC betathetapi-communications@wpi.edu

I AM LOOKING FOR FEEDBACK ON:
-Color choices
-Overall design (too simplistic?, not enough pictures of Andy?, etc.)
-Requests
-Content feedback (Dislike the idea of a carousel on the front page?, want a certain thing removed?) 

I am really terrible at art and design and all that, so any feedback on the color / design is appreciated! 

3: SCHEDULE
I will be releasing .zip files of the build as frequently as possible.
The goal is to have the website fully designed and filled with content before midterms of A-Term.

4: THINGS THAT DO NOT WORK
I wanted to have our crest on the left side of the content, and the WPI seal on the right side. 
I am shit at HTML and am still figuring out how to make it happen. For now, you can deal with the boring
white background.

The right side of the content box of the front page has a 'carousel' which will show a rotating reel of posts.
Right now the carousel doesn't work. It also doesn't have any posts. If anyone has worked with bootstrap and / or
javascript / jquery before, HOLLA AT ME.

5: FYI 
FYI I have literally never done any web programming before trying this. 
This is why I want any and all feedback. Also, if you know how to web program, get in touch.
